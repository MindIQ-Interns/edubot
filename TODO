1. Recreate the quiz_bot using REST APIs.
2. Reconnect the messenger_bot to quiz_bot using API calls.
3. Restructure the portal to get data via API calls (maybe?).

4. Beautifying front end (Angular?).
5. Advanced features: questions with difficulty levels, portal-triggered notifications, quiz_bot-triggered notifications.

Let's go!
